### bottled water

It's been a while since the last blog post. Since then Bryan Johnson had released an early version of a microplastics test and Huberman had released a podcast on microplastics. It was definitely reassuring to see that and the topics being addressed and the dicussions and questionings around what we expose ourselves to being a little more normalzed.

Bottled water might be super unavoidable, but now when I do have to drink bottled water, I aim for a glass water bottle.

I have currently been choosing the Mountain Valley Spring Water and here's a link to some research on it.

This is just a short blog update but plan to update this further with more details and thoughts but just wanted to push this one out as a lot of have asked me recently about what bottled water I'm currently drinking when I do have to opt for bottled water.
