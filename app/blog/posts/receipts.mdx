Receipts are made of thermal paper and, with exposure, can transfer Bisphenol A (BPA) into our body.

## Bisphenol A in Thermal Paper

Bisphenol A (BPA) is an endocrine-disrupting chemical. My personal opinion is that the effects of BPA are not studied enough.

Some receipts say they are BPA-free but may use the alternative bisphenol S (BPS), which also may have effects.

## Contact with Skin

Studies have shown that dermal absorption of BPA can occur when handling these papers.

## BPA in Thermal Paper

BPA on thermal paper is free. Some studies suggest increased concentrations in urinary total BPA concentrations for people who work as cashiers handling thermal paper receipts.

The unfortunate thing is that many kitchens use receipts for order tracking. So, even if you avoid touching receipts when paying for your item, the people handling your food may be using them often. They check the order on the printed receipt and then garnish your food with those same hands.

BPA amounts found on receipts are 250-1000 times greater than other commonly discussed sources of BPA, like canned food items.

Receipts are also not recyclable because of the BPA.

## Avoidance Strategies

Rejecting receipts.

At a restaurant, instead of signing the check, opt to pay with a contactless method. Instead of signing a receipt for the tip, you can interact with a screen.

## Conclusion

It's pretty hard to avoid receipts. Even if we do not touch them, others who interact with our food may touch them. My personal approach is just to be aware and to avoid them as much as reasonably possible.

There are studies that show that antioxidants help fight free radicals from BPA.
