## my stack
my dev stack is JavaScript / TypeScript and Python haha 

but my current stack is using Bryan Johnson's stack

This is a ref link to [Bryan Johnson's blueprint products](https://blueprint.bryanjohnson.com/JARRENSANJOSE). This link gives $25 off any order over $100. 

I love the peace of mind of knowing he is putting in the effort on getting the best sourcing possible and makes it really convenient and frees headspace for me. 

I have the full stack but my favorites are probably the olive oil and dark chocolate and blueberry nut mix.

## olive oil

he sources it and I drink it by itself or sometimes use it to cook when smoke point is not an issue

## dark chocolate

i love the dark chocolate, will even eat that by itself (putting straight in my mouth) or i will mix with milk for a treat and i'm blindly trusting the effort he puts in for better sourcing so hopefully less heavy metal intake with the dark chocolate and more benefits of health and just like the taste of chocolate

## blueberry and nut mix

sometimes hard to get intake in so being able to just scoop some in my mouth to get my bases covered there is great 

## the nutty pudding mix

i kind of use this more as a treat (I like the taste) and protein powder. commonly, I just put a scoop of the powder by itself in my mouth but I am also the type to just eat peanut butter by itself

## the longevity mix

i think this tastes good and sometimes I forget if I already took it for the day. I don't take it every day as I'm not sure if I want everything included in the mix as some aren't super super researched and known yet but I take maybe 40% of the time to cover my bases or just if I didn't have a very varied diet that day like making sure I get my vitamin C intake

## the various pills

helps me cover my bases and i do take them whenever I remember and I have them just sitting on my desk
