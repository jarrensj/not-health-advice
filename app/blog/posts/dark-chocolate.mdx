### I love dark chocolate

I love chocolate and especially dark chocolate. It’s my preferred and I genuinely enjoy it more than milk and white chocolate. 

### dark chocolate

Unfortunately, dark chocolate can be high in heavy metals, with dark chocolate might contain more heavy metals than other chocolates due to more cacao in dark chocolate compared to milk chocolate.

I can’t avoid chocolate, I just love chocolate too much but I am more mindful or aware when I do consume chocolate and its sourcing and how much heavy metals it can have compared to other chocolate options.

I personally have dark chocolate every day or maybe almost every other day if not every day. I currently have Bryan Johnson’s dark chocolate and subscribe to that. I have also purchased dark chocolate before from other places and have snacked on that daily. I just also love dessert. This is not health advice. Chocolate makes me happy personally.

Bryan has chocolate in levels but I think it’s also common for us to reference them as tiers, with him expressing the highest or best level being dark chocolate, not dutched, and from specific regions.

Here is also a link to Bryan Johnson’s website (and his research).
