## Release of microplastics 

This paper, [Release of microplastics from disposable cups in daily use](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36089043/), shares that:
- higher temperature can promote release of microplastics from disposable cups 
- when a cup is used a second time, the release of microplastics is notable but at a slightly lower level than the inital first use 
- acidic carbonated beverages enhance microplastic release from PE-coated cups over that of ultrapure water

## My personal avoidance strategies

I don't order takeout food at a restaurant, I cook at home. If you often bring leftover food home from a restaurant, you could try bringing your own container instead of using the styrofoam or plastic container the restaurant might provide.

I also opt for cold drinks at coffee shops (iced lattes over a hot coffee) and I frequent more often coffee shops where I can receive my drink in a glass container instead of a disposable plastic container.
